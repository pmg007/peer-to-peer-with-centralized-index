                  ASCII format for Network Interchange

   For concreteness, we suggest the use of standard 7-bit ASCII embedded
   in an 8 bit byte whose high order bit is always 0.  This leads to the
   standard code given on the attached page, copies from USAS X3, 4-
   1968.  This code will be used over HOST-HOST primary connections.
   Break characters will be defined by the receiving remote host, e.g.
   SRI uses "." (ASCII X'2E' or 2/14) as the end-of-line character,
   where as UCLA uses X'OD' or 0/13 (carriage return).
